# Monte-carlo-option-pricing

This repository documents my self-taught journey into understanding and implementing Monte Carlo methods for option pricing.

I am currently learning:

- how Monte Carlo simulations work in a financial context,

- how to simulate price paths under the Black–Scholes model,

- how to compute option payoffs and estimate their expected value,

- and more broadly, how numerical methods are used in quantitative finance.

This project is not meant to showcase expert knowledge.
It’s a training ground where I build the theory step by step and implement it in Python as I learn.

🎯 Goal of this project : 
- Understand the mathematical foundations behind Monte Carlo pricing

- Implement simulations of asset paths (GBM)

- Compute European call/put option prices

- Compare my results with the Black–Scholes closed-form solution

📚 Learning roadmap

Here is the plan I’m following:

- Mathematical basics :  Risk-neutral valuation, Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM), Expected discounted payoff
- Simulation : Generate random Brownian increments, Build price paths, Inspect their distribution
- Pricing : Compute option payoffs, Estimate price using expected discounted value, Compare with closed-form Black–Scholes
This roadmap evolves as I learn more.

🚧 Work in progress

This is an ongoing learning project.
If you visit this repository in the early stages, you’ll likely find:
- partial implementations
- simplified models
- and experiments

I’m building this from scratch to learn by doing. So if you have any tips or ressources, feel free to reach out.
